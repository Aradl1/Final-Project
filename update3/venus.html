        <h2> Venus </h2>
        <p>
            Venus is the second planet from the Sun and is often referred to as
            Earth's "sister planet" due to its similar size and mass. However,
            its conditions are vastly different, making it an inhospitable world.
            Venus has a thick, toxic atmosphere primarily composed of carbon dioxide,
            with clouds of sulfuric acid, creating a runaway greenhouse effect that traps
            heat. As a result, surface temperatures on Venus can reach up to 465°C (869°F),
            hotter than the surface of Mercury, even though Venus is farther from the Sun.
            The planet's atmosphere also causes crushing surface pressure, about 92 times that
            of Earth's. Venus has a slow rotation, taking 243 Earth days to complete one rotation,
            but it orbits the Sun faster, taking only 225 Earth days to complete an orbit.
            This means that a day on Venus is longer than a year.
            The planet's surface is mostly covered by vast plains, mountains, and volcanoes,
            many of which may still be active today. Venus has been the target of several
            spacecraft missions, such as NASA's Magellan, which mapped its surface using radar,
            and the Soviet Union's Venera program, which sent probes to study its harsh environment.
            Despite its extreme conditions, Venus remains a key object of interest for scientists
            studying planetary atmospheres and climate.
