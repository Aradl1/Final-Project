    <h2>Jupiter</h2>
    <p>
        Jupiter is the largest planet in our solar system and a gas giant,
        primarily composed of hydrogen and helium. It has a diameter of about
        143,000 kilometers (89,000 miles), making it over 11 times wider than Earth.
        Jupiter's atmosphere is known for its striking bands of clouds, which are composed
        of ammonia, methane, and water vapor, giving it a colorful and dynamic appearance.
        The most famous feature of Jupiter is the Great Red Spot, a massive storm that has
        been raging for at least 400 years. Jupiter has an extremely strong magnetic field,
        which is about 14 times stronger than Earth's, and it radiates more energy than it
        receives from the Sun, likely due to the planet's internal heat. It also has a
        large number of moons, with at least 80 confirmed, including the four Galilean
        moons—Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto—discovered by Galileo in 1610.
        These moons are of great scientific interest, especially Europa, which is believed
        to have a subsurface ocean that could harbor life. Jupiter also has a faint ring
        system, composed mainly of dust particles. Its immense size and gravitational pull
        have a significant impact on the solar system, influencing the orbits of other
        objects, including asteroids and comets. Jupiter's sheer scale and its mysteries
        continue to be a focal point for space exploration and research. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiter"
