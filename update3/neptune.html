        <h2>Neptune</h2>
        <p>
            Neptune is the eighth and farthest planet from the Sun in our solar system,
            located approximately 4.5 billion kilometers (2.8 billion miles) away.
            It is a gas giant, primarily composed of hydrogen, helium, and ices such as
            water, ammonia, and methane, which give it a distinct blue color.
            Neptune is known for its dynamic atmosphere, featuring the fastest winds in
            the solar system, which can reach speeds of up to 2,100 kilometers per hour
            (1,300 miles per hour). The planet has 14 known moons, with Triton being the
            largest and most unique, as it has a retrograde orbit, suggesting it was
            captured by Neptune's gravity rather than forming alongside it.
            Neptune also has a faint ring system and a strong magnetic field.
            Discovered in 1846, Neptune's atmosphere exhibits large storm systems,
            the most famous being the Great Dark Spot, a giant storm similar to Jupiter's
            Great Red Spot. Despite its distance and harsh conditions,
            Neptune remains a key object of study for astronomers interested in
            understanding the outer reaches of our solar system.
