        <h2> Asteroids</h2>
        <p>
            Asteroids are small, rocky objects that orbit the Sun,
            primarily found in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter,
            although they can also be found throughout the solar system.
            They are remnants from the early formation of the solar system,
            leftover material that never coalesced into planets.
            Ranging in size from tiny pebbles to objects that can be hundreds of
            kilometers in diameter, asteroids are composed mainly of metals, silicates,
            and carbon-rich materials. While most are located in the asteroid belt,
            some are categorized as near-Earth asteroids, which have orbits that bring
            them close to Earth's path. These objects are of scientific interest because
            studying them can provide insights into the early solar system, as they are
            considered some of the most primitive bodies in space. Some asteroids have
            even been targeted for exploration by space missions, such as NASA's OSIRIS-REx,
            which recently collected samples from the asteroid Bennu.
