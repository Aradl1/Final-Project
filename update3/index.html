        <h2>Major Planets</h2>
        <p>
        On this web page my goal is to
        help provide some additional imformation
        about the different planets in our solar system. The major planets in our
        solar system are divided into two categories: the inner, rocky planets and the
        outer, gas giants. The inner planets—Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars—are composed
        mostly of rock and metal and have relatively small, dense structures.
        Mercury is the closest to the Sun and has extreme temperature fluctuations,
        while Venus is known for its thick, toxic atmosphere and surface temperatures
        hot enough to melt lead. Earth, the only planet known to support life, has a
        diverse environment with liquid water, and Mars, with its red surface and large
        volcanoes, is a key focus for exploration, as it may have once harbored life.
        The outer planets—Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune—are much larger and are
        primarily composed of gases, with thick atmospheres made mostly of hydrogen and
        helium. Jupiter, the largest planet, has a famous storm system known as the Great
        Red Spot, and Saturn is famous for its expansive and striking ring system.
        Uranus and Neptune, often called the "ice giants," have colder, methane-rich
        atmospheres and unique axial tilts. These outer planets also have many moons,
        some of which, like Jupiter's Europa or Saturn's Titan, are of particular interest
        to scientists studying the possibility of life beyond Earth.
